The paper posits that this ontological gap is one of the reasons responsible for the failures of AI, in realizing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capacities. Moreover, the authors postulate that the implementation of the biosemiotics perspective and a subjective judgment in synthetic agents would seem to be a necessary precondition for a synthetic system to realize human-like cognition and intelligence. The paper concludes with general remarks on the state of AI technology and its conceptual underpinnings.},

Marcus also addresses the putative puzzles about substitutivity and about essentialism. The collection also includes influential essays on moral conflict, on belief and rationality, and on some historical figures.

Materialism, in this form, often now gets involved in very intricate ways in questions about what is necessary or contingent in identity of properties — questions like that. So, it is really very important to philosophers who may want to work in many domains to get clear about these concepts.

            Current learning machines have successfully solved hard application problems, reaching high accuracy and displaying seemingly intelligent behavior. Here we apply recent techniques for explaining decisions of state-of-the-art learning machines and analyze various tasks from computer vision and arcade games. This showcases a spectrum of problem-solving behaviors ranging from naive and short-sighted, to well-informed and strategic. We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors. Furthermore, we propose our semi-automated Spectral Relevance Analysis that provides a practically effective way of characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines. This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for. Furthermore, our work intends to add a voice of caution to the ongoing excitement about machine intelligence and pledges to evaluate and judge some of these recent successes in a more nuanced manner.},

	abstract = {From the Publisher: With advanced computer technologies and their omnipresent usage, data accumulates in a speed unmatchable by the human's capacity to process data. To meet this growing challenge, the research community of knowledge discovery from databases emerged. The key issue studied by this community is, in layman's terms, to make advantageous use of large stores of data. In order to make raw data useful, it is necessary to represent, process, and extract knowledge for various applications. Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining offers an overview of the methods developed since the 1970's and provides a general framework in order to examine these methods and categorize them. This book employs simple examples to show the essence of representative feature selection methods and compares them using data sets with combinations of intrinsic properties according to the objective of feature selection. In addition, the book suggests guidelines for how to use different methods under various circumstances and points out new challenges in this exciting area of research. Feature Selection for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining is intended to be used by researchers in machine learning, data mining, knowledge discovery, and databases as a toolbox of relevant tools that help in solving large real-world problems. This book is also intended to serve as a reference book or secondary text for courses on machine learning, data mining, and databases.},

            What are the essential properties of ordinary individuals such as people, cats, trees, and tables? The question is notoriously difficult, yet must be answered to obtain a satisfying account of the ways in which such individuals could and could not have been different from the way that they are. The book provides a novel treatment of this issue, in the context of a set of debates initiated by the revival of interest in essentialism and de re modality generated by the work of Kripke and others in the 1970s. Via a critical examination of rival theories, it argues for ‘minimalist essentialism’: an unorthodox theory according to which ordinary individuals have relatively few interesting essential properties. The book therefore presents a challenge to stronger versions of essentialism, including the view that ordinary individuals have non-trivial individual essences; versions of Kripke’s necessity of origin thesis; and the widely held theory of ‘sortal essentialism’, according to which an individual belongs essentially to some sort or kind that determines its conditions for identity over time. The book includes discussion of the rivalry between the interpretation of de re modality in terms of identity across possible worlds and its interpretation in terms of counterpart theory. It provides a detailed defence of the apparently paradoxical claim that there can be possible worlds that differ from one another only in the identities of some of the individuals that they contain, and hence that identities across possible worlds may be ‘bare’ identities. The book also contains a discussion of the relation between essentialism about individuals and essentialism about natural kinds, and a critical examination of the connection between semantics and natural kind essentialism.},

The cooperation between philosophy and machine learning has been recognized to be mutually beneficial that may provide fundamental shift in the paradigms of both camps. In this paper, a unidirectional interaction between philosophy and machine learning is considered. This type of interaction becomes necessary as we reflect upon the practical implications of the model construction. To this extent, I review a specific set of contributions of philosophy to machine learning in determining epistemic standing of object representation and algorithmic design. I discuss three aspects of statistical models, pertaining to semantics of object representation, namely idealization (simplifying properties of an object), abstraction (representing an object with another object that is easier to handle), and use of latent variables. I argue to what extent these aspects necessitate philosophical attention to justify their practical use. To this end, I elucidate different philosophical concepts that are utilized by researchers mostly tacitly when dealing with uncertainties in features and their functional relationships. This is expected to help pave the way for further investigations on semantics of object representation in machine learning.},

	abstract = {The daring idea that convention - human decision - lies at the root both of necessary truths and much of empirical science reverberates through twentieth-century philosophy, constituting a revolution comparable to Kant's Copernican revolution. This book provides a comprehensive study of Conventionalism. Drawing a distinction between two conventionalist theses, the under-determination of science by empirical fact, and the linguistic account of necessity, Yemima Ben-Menahem traces the evolution of both ideas to their origins in Poincaré's geometric conventionalism. She argues that the radical extrapolations of Poincaré's ideas by later thinkers, including Wittgenstein, Quine, and Carnap, eventually led to the decline of conventionalism. This book provides a fresh perspective on twentieth-century philosophy. Many of the major themes of contemporary philosophy emerge in this book as arising from engagement with the challenge of conventionalism.},

	abstract = {Causal essentialists hold that a property essentially bears its causal and nomic relations. Further, as many causal essentialists have noted, the main motivations for causal essentialism also motivate holding that properties are individuated in terms of their causal and nomic relations. This amounts to a kind of identity of indiscernibles thesis; properties that are indiscernible with respect to their causal and nomic relations are identical. This can be compared with the more well-known identity of indiscernibles thesis, according to which particulars that are qualitatively indiscernible are identical. Robert Adams has developed a well-known objection to this thesis by considering a series of possibilities involving nearly qualitatively indiscernible particulars that naturally leads to a possibility involving qualitatively indiscernible particulars. I argue that we can construct parallel cases involving a series of possibilities involving properties that are nearly indiscernible with respect to their causal and nomic relations that naturally lead to possibilities involving properties that are indiscernible with respect to their causal and nomic relations. The same features that make Adams’ argument forceful also carry over to my cases, giving us a powerful objection to the causal essentialist identity of indiscernibles thesis.},
