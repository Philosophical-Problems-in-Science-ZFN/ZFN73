Intelligent behaviour becomes immediately understandable in this approach because semiosis combines causality with the triadic structure of the semiotic sign. Intelligence is a process created in a given context. In the course of evolution organisms have learned to create increasingly sophisticated internal representations of external state. Semiosis is the precursor of the emergence of a feature we consider intelligence. Biosemiotics also draws attention to the distributed intelligence, which relies on external semiotic scaffoldings as much as on the subject’s abilities and knowledge.},

	abstract = {At the origin of multicellularity, cells may have evolved aggregation in response to predation, for functional specialisation or to allow large-scale integration of environmental cues. These group-level properties emerged from the interactions between cells in a group, and determined the selection pressures experienced by these cells. We investigate the evolution of multicellularity with an evolutionary model where cells search for resources by chemotaxis in a shallow, noisy gradient. Cells can evolve their adhesion to others in a periodically changing environment, where a cell’s fitness solely depends on its distance from the gradient source. We show that multicellular aggregates evolve because they perform chemotaxis more efficiently than single cells. Only when the environment changes too frequently, a unicellular state evolves which relies on cell dispersal. Both strategies prevent the invasion of the other through interference competition, creating evolutionary bi-stability. Therefore, collective behaviour can be an emergent selective driver for undifferentiated multicellularity.
          , 
            All multicellular organisms, from fungi to humans, started out life as single cell organisms. These cells were able to survive on their own for billions of years before aggregating together to form multicellular groups. Although there are trade-offs for being in a group, such as sharing resources, there are also benefits: in a group, single cells can divide tasks amongst themselves to become more efficient, and can develop sophisticated mechanisms to protect each other from harm. But what compelled single cells to make the first move and aggregate into a group?
            One way to answer this question is to study the behaviour of slime moulds. These organisms exist as single cells but form colonies when their resources run low. Researchers have observed that slime mould colonies can navigate their environment much better than single cells alone. This property suggests that the benefits of moving together as a collective could be the driving factor propelling single cells to form groups.
            To test this theory, Colizzi et al. developed a computer model to examine how well groups of cells and lone individuals responded to nearby chemical cues. Unlike previous simulations, the model created by Colizzi et al. did not specify that being in a group was necessarily more favourable than existing as a single cell. Instead, it was left for evolution to decide which was the best option in response to the changing environmental conditions of the simulation.
            The mathematical model showed that groups of cells were generally better at sensing and moving towards a resource than single cells acting alone. Single cells moved at the same speed as groups, but they often sensed their environment poorly and got disorientated. Only when the environment changed frequently, did cells revert back to the single life. This was because it was no longer beneficial to band together as a group, as the cells were unable to sense the environmental cues fast enough to communicate to each other and coordinate a response.
            This work provides insights into what drove the early evolution of complex life and explains why, under certain conditions, single cells evolved to form colonies. Additionally, if this model were to be adopted by cancer biologists, it could help researchers better understand how cancer cells form groups to move and spread around the body.},

	abstract = {Animal behavior often forms sequences, built from simple stereotyped actions and shaped by environmental cues. A comprehensive characterization of the interplay between an animal’s movements and its environment is necessary to understand the sensorimotor transformations performed by the brain. Here, we use unsupervised methods to study behavioral sequences in zebraﬁsh larvae. We generate a map of swim bouts, revealing that ﬁsh modulate their tail movements along a continuum. During prey capture, larvae produce stereotyped sequences using a subset of bouts from a broader behavioral repertoire. These sequences exhibit loworder transition dynamics and immediately respond to changes in visual cues. Chaining of prey capture bouts is disrupted in visually impaired (lakritz and blumenkohl) mutants, and removing the prey stimulus during ongoing behavior in closed-loop virtual reality causes larvae to immediately abort the hunting sequence. These results suggest that the continuous integration of sensory information is necessary to structure the behavior. This stimulus-response loop serves to bring prey into the anterior dorsal visual ﬁeld of the larvae. Fish then release a capture strike maneuver comprising a stereotyped jaw movement and tail movements ﬁne-tuned to the distance of the prey. Fish with only one intact eye fail to correctly position the prey in the strike zone, but are able to produce the strike itself. Our analysis shows that short-term integration of binocular visual cues shapes the behavioral dynamics of hunting, thus uncovering the temporal organization of a goal-directed behavior in a vertebrate.},

Such hierarchies occur throughout biology, from the architectures of intracellular signal transduction pathways to the large-scale organization of perception and action cycles in the mammalian brain. Formally, the close formal connections between cone-cocone diagrams (CCCD) as models of quantum reference frames on the one hand, and between CCCDs and topological quantum field theories on the other, allow the representation of such computations in the fully-general quantum-computational framework of topological quantum neural networks.},

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},
